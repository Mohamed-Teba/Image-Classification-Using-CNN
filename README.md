# 📷 Image Classification Using CNN 🧠

Welcome to the **Image Classification Using CNN** project! 🚀 This project harnesses the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images into predefined categories. Whether it's identifying objects, animals, or other visual patterns, this system leverages deep learning to deliver accurate and efficient results. 🌟

---

## 🌟 Overview

Image classification is a cornerstone of computer vision, with applications in fields like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and more. This project builds a CNN-based model to classify images using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It draws inspiration from the author's previous work, such as the [Face Detection System](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/Face-Detection-System), but focuses on general image classification tasks. 📸
